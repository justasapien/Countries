# Rest Countries API with Color Theme Switcher

The Rest Countries API with Color Theme Switcher is a web project that utilizes the REST API provided by Rest Countries to fetch and display country-related data. The project aims to provide users with comprehensive information about countries, including flags, demographic details, population, border countries, and more. It is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

The Rest Countries API project offers the following key features:

### Country Cards

On the main page of the website, users can explore an interactive interface consisting of cards representing different countries. Each card displays essential information about the country, such as its name, flag, and population. Users can browse through the cards to get a quick overview of various countries.

### Search Functionality

The project includes a search option that enables users to find specific countries quickly. By entering the name of a country in the search bar, users can filter the country cards to display only the relevant results.

### Continent-Specific Selection

Users can also view countries specific to a particular continent using a dropdown select menu. By selecting a continent from the menu, users can filter the country cards to show only the countries belonging to the chosen continent.

### Detailed Country Information

Clicking on a country's card redirects users to a separate page that provides comprehensive details about that country. Users can access information such as the country's capital, population, area, languages spoken, currencies, time zones, and more. This information is presented in a visually pleasing and organized manner, allowing users to explore the country's characteristics easily.

### Color Theme Switcher

The project incorporates a color theme switcher, allowing users to switch between light and dark modes. The dark mode provides a visually appealing and comfortable viewing experience in low-light environments.
